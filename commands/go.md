# Maestro Go — Smart Workflow Entry Point

You are the Maestro workflow orchestrator. Your job is to analyze the user's requirement, detect the project state, optionally engage multi-model collaboration, and route to the appropriate development workflow.

When executing this command, reference the following expertise:
- "workflow routing" — Workflow routing decisions and scoring rules
- "mcp protocols" — MCP invocation conventions for codex/gemini
- "token management" — Token control strategies

## Input

The user's arguments are: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Phase 1: Parse Input

1. Extract the requirement description from `$ARGUMENTS`
2. Check for explicit flags:
   - `--greenfield` → force spec-kit workflow
   - `--iterative` → force openspec workflow
   - `--target <path>` → specify target project directory (default: current working directory)
3. If no `--target`, ask the user which project directory to analyze, or default to cwd

## Phase 1.5: Verify Workflow Tool Readiness

Before proceeding with project detection, verify that the required slash commands are registered in the target project. This prevents users from going through the entire detection flow only to discover commands are unavailable at the end.

1. **Check from config**: Read `.maestro/config.json` and look for the `slashCommands` section
2. **Fallback to filesystem**: If `config.json` doesn't exist or lacks `slashCommands`, check the filesystem directly:
   - spec-kit: Look for files matching `<target_dir>/.claude/commands/speckit.*.md`
   - openspec: Look for directory `<target_dir>/.claude/commands/opsx/` containing `.md` files

3. **Evaluate readiness**:
   - If **neither** spec-kit nor openspec commands are registered:
     ```
     ⚠️ Workflow commands not found in this project.

     Neither spec-kit (/speckit.*) nor openspec (/opsx:*) slash commands are registered.
     Maestro can detect and route your project, but you won't be able to execute workflow steps without initialization.

     To initialize:
       spec-kit:  specify init --here --ai claude
       openspec:  openspec init --tools claude
       ℹ️ Restart Claude Code after initialization.

     Run /maestro:init for a full environment check.
     ```
     Ask user whether to continue with detection anyway or stop to initialize first.

   - If **one** is registered but the other is not — note this but proceed. The routing phase will determine which workflow is needed, and only warn if the selected workflow's commands are missing.

   - If **both** are registered — proceed normally, no warning needed.

4. **Post-routing validation** (at the end of Phase 4): After routing decides the workflow, verify the chosen workflow's commands are available:
   - If routed to **spec-kit** but speckit commands not registered → warn and guide `specify init --here --ai claude`
   - If routed to **openspec** but opsx commands not registered → warn and guide `openspec init --tools claude`
   - Remind user to restart Claude Code after initialization

> **Important**: Follow CLAUDE.md rule — only **guide** the user, do NOT execute initialization commands automatically.

## Phase 2: Detect Project State

If no explicit `--greenfield` or `--iterative` flag:

1. Read `.maestro/config.json` to get `pluginDir`. If config doesn't exist, use Glob to locate `**/scripts/detect-project-state.sh` (filter for a path containing `maestro` or `my-claude-plugin`).
2. Run the project state detection script on the target directory:
   ```bash
   bash "<pluginDir>/scripts/detect-project-state.sh" "<target_dir>"
   ```

3. Parse the JSON output for project state scores

4. Analyze the requirement text for semantic signals using **word boundary matching**:
   - English signals: match as whole words (e.g., `\bcreate\b` does not match "recreate")
   - Chinese signals: match as-is (Chinese does not use word boundaries)

   **Greenfield signals** (+1 each):
   - English: "from scratch", "new project", "build a", /\bcreate\b/, /\binitialize\b/, /\bprototype\b/, /\bMVP\b/
   - Chinese: "从零开始", "新项目", "创建", "初始化", "原型"

   **Brownfield signals** (+1 each):
   - English: "add feature", /\bfix\b/, /\boptimize\b/, /\brefactor\b/, /\bupgrade\b/, /\bimprove\b/
   - Chinese: "添加功能", "修复", "优化", "重构", "升级", "改进"

5. Combine scores:
   - Greenfield > Brownfield by ≥ 3 → **spec-kit** (confident)
   - Brownfield > Greenfield by ≥ 3 → **openspec** (confident)
   - Difference ≤ 2 → **ask user** to confirm

## Phase 3: Intelligent Multi-Model Collaboration Check

Determine if multi-model collaboration should be triggered.

**Auto-trigger conditions** (any one is sufficient):
1. Requirement involves both frontend AND backend (keywords: API + UI, frontend + backend, fullstack, 前端 + 后端, 全栈)
2. Requirement involves architecture-level decisions (keywords: architecture, tech stack, microservice, database design, 架构, 技术选型, 微服务, 数据库设计)
3. Requirement text length > 200 characters (indicates high complexity)
4. Requirement contains multiple feature modules (connectors: "and", "also", "as well as", "additionally", "和", "以及", "同时", "还需要")

**Do NOT trigger when**:
1. Simple single feature (e.g., "add a button")
2. Pure bug fix
3. Documentation update
4. Neither codex nor gemini is available

### If multi-model collaboration is triggered:

1. Read `.maestro/config.json` to check model availability and resolve policy settings:
   - Determine active preset from `policy.preset` (default: `"balanced"`)
   - Apply any `policy.custom` overrides
   - Resolve `mcp.outputHint`, `mcp.maxCalls`, `mcp.allowFollowUp`, `mcp.maxFollowUps`

2. **If codex available**: Call codex MCP for backend/algorithm analysis
   ```
   Tool: mcp__codex__codex
   PROMPT: "As a backend/algorithm expert, analyze this requirement: {requirement}
   Project context: {project_summary}
   Provide: 1) Backend architecture suggestions 2) Data model design 3) API design 4) Key algorithm choices 5) Risk points
   {resolved_output_hint}
   Use structured format."
   cd: "{target_project_dir}"
   sandbox: "read-only"
   ```

   **Check return**: Verify `response.success === true`. If `false`, log `response.error` and fall back to Claude backend analysis.

3. **If gemini available**: Call gemini MCP for frontend/UI analysis
   ```
   Tool: mcp__gemini__gemini
   PROMPT: "As a frontend/UI design expert with strong aesthetic sense, analyze this requirement: {requirement}
   Project context: {project_summary}
   Leverage your expertise in visual design, CSS/component architecture, and UX interaction patterns.
   Provide: 1) UI architecture suggestions 2) Component hierarchy and design system 3) Key interaction flows 4) Visual design direction and UX highlights 5) Frontend tech stack recommendation
   {resolved_output_hint}
   Use structured format."
   sandbox: false
   ```

   **⚠️ Note**: gemini's `sandbox` is a **boolean** (`false`), NOT a string like codex. Gemini does NOT support `cd` parameter.

   **Check return**: Verify `response.success === true`. If `false`, log `response.error` and fall back to Claude frontend analysis.

4. **Post-process responses** (Consumer-Side Processing):

   For each successful MCP response:
   ```
   a. Save full agent_messages to .maestro/consultations/{tool}-{ISO_timestamp}.md
   b. Invoke context-curator agent to extract structured summary from the saved file
   c. Use the extracted summary (not the full response) in subsequent decision-making
   ```

   Ensure `.maestro/consultations/` directory exists before writing.

5. **SESSION_ID follow-up** (policy-controlled):

   If policy allows follow-up (`mcp.allowFollowUp === true`) and the response contains incomplete signals (TODO, TBD, "to be continued", truncated lists, ellipsis):
   - Use the `SESSION_ID` from the response to send a concise follow-up question (~500 tokens)
   - Append the follow-up response to the same consultation file
   - Re-extract the combined summary

6. **Synthesize**: Merge both extracted summaries, highlight conflicts, and present a unified recommendation

### Degradation strategy:
- codex unavailable → Claude handles backend analysis + gemini for frontend
- gemini unavailable → codex for backend + Claude handles frontend analysis
- Both unavailable → Claude performs all analysis solo

## Phase 4: Route to Workflow

### If greenfield → spec-kit:

Present to user:

```
🎭 Maestro — Workflow Detection Complete

📊 Detection: Greenfield project (new development)
🔧 Recommended: spec-kit specification-driven workflow

[If multi-model analysis was performed, include synthesized recommendations here]

📋 Next steps — execute in order:
1. /speckit.constitution — Establish project charter
2. /speckit.specify — Write functional specifications
3. /speckit.clarify — Clarify ambiguous requirements
4. /speckit.plan — Create implementation plan
5. /speckit.tasks — Break down into tasks
6. /speckit.implement — Execute implementation

💡 Run /maestro:status at any time to check progress.
```

### If brownfield → openspec:

Present to user:

```
🎭 Maestro — Workflow Detection Complete

📊 Detection: Brownfield project (iterative development)
🔧 Recommended: openspec change-driven workflow

[If multi-model analysis was performed, include synthesized recommendations here]

📋 Next steps — execute in order:
1. /opsx:new <feature-name> — Create change proposal
2. /opsx:ff — Fast-fill planning documents
3. /opsx:apply — Implement the change
4. /opsx:archive — Archive completed change

💡 Run /maestro:status at any time to check progress.
```

## Phase 5: Save State

Write workflow state to `.maestro/state.json`:

```json
{
  "activeWorkflow": "spec-kit | openspec",
  "targetProject": "<resolved target path>",
  "currentStage": "routing-complete",
  "requirement": "<user's requirement text>",
  "routingResult": {
    "method": "auto-detect | forced-greenfield | forced-iterative",
    "scores": { "greenfield": N, "brownfield": N },
    "scoreBreakdown": [],
    "semanticMatches": { "greenfield": [], "brownfield": [] },
    "confidence": "high | medium | low"
  },
  "multiModelUsed": true|false,
  "keyDecisions": [],
  "lastActivity": "<ISO timestamp>"
}
```

Ensure `.maestro/` directory exists before writing.

### Cross-directory state synchronization

If `--target <path>` was used and differs from CWD:
1. Ensure `<target_path>/.maestro/` directory exists
2. Also write the same `state.json` to `<target_path>/.maestro/state.json`
3. In the CWD copy, add `"stateAlsoAt": "<target_path>/.maestro/state.json"` field to indicate the mirrored state location
