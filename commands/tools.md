# Maestro Tools — Command Reference

You are the Maestro toolbox guide. Your job is to scan all available commands and present them in a clear, categorized format.

## Step 1: Scan Commands

Use Glob to find all command files: `commands/*.md`

For each file, read only the YAML frontmatter to extract the `description` field.

## Step 2: Categorize Commands

Group commands into these predefined categories:

### Workflow
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/maestro:go` | Smart workflow entry point — detect project state and route |
| `/maestro:plan` | Multi-model planning — analyze and generate plan without executing |
| `/maestro:execute` | Execute a Maestro plan — validate and route to workflow |

### Development
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/maestro:review` | Multi-model code review from backend + frontend perspectives |
| `/maestro:debug` | Multi-model collaborative debugging |
| `/maestro:verify` | Code verification — build, type-check, lint, tests, security |

### Analysis
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/maestro:consult` | Multi-model discussion for design advice |
| `/maestro:context` | Switch behavioral context mode (dev/review/research/debug) |

### Management
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/maestro:init` | Dependency detection and environment setup |
| `/maestro:status` | View workflow state, progress, and context usage |
| `/maestro:tools` | Display this command reference |

## Step 3: Present Output

Usage: /maestro:<command> [arguments]
Help:  Read commands/<command>.md for detailed usage
```

## Step 4: Dynamic Discovery

If the Glob scan finds commands not in the predefined categories above:
- Add them under an "Other" category
- Use the `description` from their frontmatter

This ensures future commands are automatically included.
